# Working with R

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is available as a module (see [Using Module](../04_software/02_modules.md) for more information) and
it is also an interactive app on Open onDemand (see [Introduction to Open OnDemand (OOD)](../08_using-ood/01_introduction.md) for more information). You can also use R with Anaconda. See [Working with Conda/Miniconda/Anaconda](./04_conda.md) and the [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/r-language-pkg-docs/) for more information

If you work with R packages, using a Packrat environment can be helpful. Use the procedure below to create a Packrat environment on Discovery.

## Creating a Packrat Environment (for R)

Packrat is an application that helps you manage packages for R. After you create a new directory for your R project, you can then use Packrat
to store your package dependencies inside it. For more information about Packrat, see the website: <https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/>.

1. Connect to Discovery.

2. Type `module load R/3.6.2`.

3. Create a new directory for your R project by typing, `mkdir /scratch/<yourusername>/<directoryname>` where `yourusername` is your user name, and `directoryname` is the name of the directory you want to create for your R project. For example, `/scratch/j.smith/r_testlab`

4. Open the R interface and install Packrat:

   ```
   install.packages("packrat") #during the installation, you will be prompted to install in a local directory, as you cannot install as root
   ```

5. Initialize the environment where R packages will be written to:

   ```
   packrat::init("/scratch/<yourusername>/<directoryname>")
   ```

You can then install R packages that you need. For example, to install a package called `rtracklayer`, type the following:

```
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("rtracklayer")
```
