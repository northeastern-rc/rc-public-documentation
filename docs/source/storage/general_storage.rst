General Data Storage Options
*****************************
The Research Computing (RC) team is responsible for the procurement and ongoing
maintenance of several data storage options, including active and archive
storage solutions. If you are affiliated with Northeastern, you can request
one or more storage solutions to meet your storage needs. It is highly recommended
that if you anticipate needing storage as part of a grant requirement,
schedule a consultation with a Research Computing staff member to understand what
storage options would best meet your research needs.
You can schedule an online consultation on the `RC website <https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting>`_.

.. note::
   If you have an account on Discovery, see :ref:`discovery_storage`

.. important::
   If you are not connected to the campus internet, you must be connected to
   the university's VPN (GlobalProtect) before you can access these storage systems.
