General Data Storage Options
*****************************
The Research Computing (RC) team is responsible for the procurement and ongoing
maintenance of several data storage options, including active and archive
storage solutions. If you are affiliated with Northeastern, you can request
one or more storage solutions to meet your storage needs. If you anticipate needing storage as part of a grant requirement,
please `schedule a consultation with an RC staff member <https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting>`_.

.. note::
   If you have an account on Discovery, see :ref:`discovery_storage`
   for details on the storage available to you specifically for use with Discovery's compute resources. The option listed below is not connected to Discovery.

**NAME:** ``/nese``
  - **DESCRIPTION:** This is archival, non-performant storage intended for researchers
    who need to have a long-term storage option for their data.
  - **QUOTA:** Each group can request up to **35TB** of free storage across all supplemental storage tiers: ``/work/<groupname>``, ``/research``, and ``/nese``.  

..
     **NAME:** ``/secure``
     - **DESCRIPTION:** Secure data storage is restricted to data that must be stored in a secure,
     encrypted server, such as personally identifiable information (PII) data.
     You should first set up a consultation with a Research Computing staff member using the link above to
     determine if your data requires secure storage before requesting it.

.. important::
   If you are not connected to the campus internet, you must be connected to
   the university's VPN (GlobalProtect) before you can access these storage systems.
   You can find detailed information about downloading and using the GlobalProtect VPN
   in the `FAQ: VPN and remote access <https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0013983>`_.

.. note::
   The /research storage tier is no longer provided. If you are a former user of /research and have questions or issues related to /research, please `submit a ticket to RC <https://bit.ly/NURC-Assistance>`_. Other storage options include /work (more information found here, :ref:`discovery_storage`), `Sharepoint <https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012695>`_, and `OneDrive <https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012764>`_.
