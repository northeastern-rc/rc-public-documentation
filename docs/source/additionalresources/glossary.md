# Glossary of Terms
This glossary provides definitions for terms and abbreviations you may encounter when using our HPC cluster.

-------
Cluster
: A group of computers connected in a way that allows them to function as a single system.

Core
: A processor within a CPU. Each core can execute its tasks.

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
: The primary component of a computer that performs most processing inside the computer. CPUs can have multiple cores.
Home Directory

: A user's directory in the cluster where personal files, application settings, and other user-specific data are stored.

HPC (High-Performance Computing)
: The use of parallel processing for running advanced application programs efficiently, reliably, and quickly. It's often used for scientific research, big data analysis, and modeling complex systems.

Node
: A single machine within a cluster. A node can have multiple processors and its memory and storage.


GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
: A specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device.


Job
: A set of computations a user submits to the HPC cluster for execution.

Job Script
: A file that contains a series of commands that the HPC cluster will execute.

Module
: In the context of HPC, a module is a bundle of software that can be loaded or unloaded in the user's environment.

Partition
: A division of the cluster resources. Each partition can have different configurations, such as different types of nodes and different access policies.

Queue
: A waiting line for jobs ready to be executed but waiting for resources to become available.

Scheduler
: A program that manages the cluster's resources and allocates them to jobs based on priority, requested resources, and fair use policies.

Slurm
: An open-source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system for large and small HPC clusters.
