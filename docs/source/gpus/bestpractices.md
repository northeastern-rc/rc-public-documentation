# Best Practices for GPUs

Utilizing GPUs effectively in a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster with high demand for multiple GPUs requires careful {term}`management <gpu memory management>` and optimization. Here are some best practices to make the most of GPU resources:

## Best Practices
By implementing these best practices, you can efficiently manage GPU resources in your Slurm cluster, ensuring optimal performance, fair resource allocation, and resilience to high-demand scenarios. These practices will benefit both individual users and the overall efficiency of your HPC environment.

### Resource Allocation
**Techniques:**

- **Use Specific Partitions**: Submit GPU-intensive jobs to GPU-specific partitions to ensure efficient resource allocation. Different partitions may have varying GPU types and configurations.

- **Specify GPU Requests**: Clearly define the number of GPUs required for your job using the `--gres=gpu:X` option in your job script, where `X` is the number of GPUs.


**Best Practice:** Use Specific Partitions and Specify GPU Requests

**Example:**

:::{code} bash
#SBATCH --partition=gpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:2
:::

**Benefits:**

- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Submitting GPU-intensive jobs to GPU-specific partitions ensures that your jobs are allocated to nodes with the required GPU resources.

- **Resource Isolation**: Different partitions may have varying GPU types and configurations, allowing you to isolate your job based on specific GPU capabilities.

### GPU Memory Management
**Techniques:**
- **Monitor GPU Memory**: Keep an eye on GPU memory usage using tools like NVIDIA's `nvidia-smi` or system-level monitoring tools. Avoid exhausting GPU memory, which can lead to job failures.
- **Memory Cleanup**: Release GPU memory resources when they are no longer needed within your code. Explicitly deallocate memory to prevent memory leaks.

**Best Practice**: Monitor GPU Memory and Implement Memory Cleanup

**Example**: Using nvidia-smi to monitor GPU memory usage.

**Benefits**:

- **Preventing Memory Exhaustion**: Regularly monitoring GPU memory helps prevent jobs from running out of memory, which can lead to job failures.
- **Optimal Memory Usage**: Implementing memory cleanup in your code ensures that GPU memory is released when it's no longer needed, preventing memory leaks and maximizing memory utilization.

### Parallelization

**Techniques:**
- **Optimize Parallelization**: Utilize parallel programming libraries and techniques, such as CUDA or OpenCL, to fully exploit GPU parallel processing capabilities.
- **Multi-GPU Scaling**: Consider multi-GPU scaling by distributing tasks across multiple GPUs if your application supports it. This can significantly speed up computations.

**Best Practice**: Optimize Parallelization and Consider Multi-GPU Scaling

**Example**:

:::{code} python
# Parallelizing a task across multiple GPUs using CUDA
import torch

# Define a neural network model
model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model).cuda()
:::
**Benefits**:
- **Performance Boost**: Optimizing parallelization with tools like CUDA can lead to significant speedups in GPU-accelerated applications.
- **Scalability**: Multi-GPU scaling allows you to distribute tasks across multiple GPUs, which is crucial for handling computationally intensive workloads efficiently.

### Job Prioritization
**Techniques:**
- **Fair Resource Sharing**: Collaborate with cluster users and administrators to establish fair resource-sharing policies. Prioritize jobs based on research and project needs.
- **Job Preemption**: Be prepared for job preemption in a high-demand environment. Configure your job scripts to checkpoint progress and handle preemptions gracefully.

**Best Practice**: Collaborate on Fair Resource Sharing and Handle Job Preemption

**Example**:

:::{code} bash
#SBATCH --priority=high
:::

**Benefits**:
- **Equitable Resource Allocation**: Collaborative job prioritization ensures that resources are allocated fairly among users, promoting a balanced cluster usage.
- **Resilience to Preemption**: Handling job preemption gracefully by checkpointing progress and resuming jobs minimizes disruptions and ensures task completion.

### GPU-Aware Software
**Techniques:**
- **GPU-Accelerated Libraries**: Use GPU-accelerated libraries and frameworks when available. They can significantly speed up computations without extensive code modifications.
- **Profiling and Optimization**: Profile your GPU-accelerated code to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance. Tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems can assist in this process.

**Best Practice**: Utilize GPU-Accelerated Libraries and Profile for Optimization

**Example**: Using cuDNN for deep learning tasks.

**Benefits**:

- **Performance Gains**: GPU-accelerated libraries like cuDNN can significantly speed up computations without extensive code modifications.
- **Efficient Code**: Profiling GPU-accelerated code helps identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities, leading to more efficient GPU utilization.

These best practices, along with efficient resource allocation and job prioritization, will help you make the most of GPU resources in a high-demand HPC cluster environment with multiple GPUs. Be mindful of efficient GPU memory management and parallelization techniques to ensure optimal performance for your computations.
