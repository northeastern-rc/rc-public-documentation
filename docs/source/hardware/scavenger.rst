Partitions

:sub:`Updated July 31, 2020`

Introduction
===================
Partitions are logical collections of nodes that comprise different hardware resources and limits to
help meet the wide variety of jobs that get scheduled on Discovery. Occasionally, the Research Computing
team might need to make updates to the partitions based on monitoring job submissions to help reduce job
wait times. As our cluster grows, changes to the partitions also help to ensure the fair, efficient
distribution of resources for all jobs being submitted to the cluster.

On Discovery, there are several different partitions:

* General access (``debug``, ``express``, ``short``, ``gpu``)
* Application only (``long``, ``large``, ``multigpu``)
* PI owned (accessed only by members of the PIs’ group)

The general access and application only partitions span the hardware on Discovery, with ``gpu`` and ``multigpu`` spanning the GPUs on Discovery and the other partitions spanning the CPUs.
For example, if you use the ``debug`` partition you're using the same hardware as ``short``, just with different time, job, and core limits. Refer to the tables below for
detailed information on the current partitions. Note that PI-owned partitions only include the hardware that those PIs own and are only accessible to the members of the PI's group.

Viewing partition information
==============================
Slurm commands allow you to view information about the partitions. Three commands that can show you partition information are ``sinfo``, ``sacct``, and ``scontrol``. The following are common options to use with these commands::

 sinfo -p <partition name> #displays the state of the nodes on a specific partition
 sinfo -p <partition name> --Format=time,nodes,cpus,socketcorethread,memory,nodeai,features #displays more detailed information using the Format option, including features like the type of processors
 sacct --partition <partition name> #displays the jobs that have been run on this partition
 scontrol show partition <partition name> #displays the Slurm configuration of the partition

For more information about these commands, see the Slurm documentation site https://slurm.schedmd.com/.

Allocating partitions in your jobs
===================================
To specify a partition when running jobs, use the option ``--partition=<partition name>`` with either ``srun`` or ``sbatch``. When using a partition with your job and
specifying the options of ``--nodes=`` and ``--ntasks=``, make sure that you are requesting options that best fit your job. **Requesting the maximum number of nodes or tasks will not make your job run faster or give you higher priority in the job queue.** It can actually have
the opposite effect on jobs that are better suited to running with smaller requirements, as you have to wait for the extra resources that your job will not use. See :ref:`using_slurm` for more information on using Slurm to run jobs.

.. tip::
   You should always try to have job requests that will attempt to allocate the best resources for the job you want to run. For example, if you are running a job that is not parallelized, you only need to request one node (``--nodes=1``). For some parallel jobs, such as a small MPI job, you can also use one node (``--nodes=1``) with the ``–-ntasks=`` option set to correspond to the number of MPI ranks (tasks) in your code. For example, for a job that has 12 MPI ranks, request 1 node and 12 tasks within that node (``--nodes=1 –-ntasks=12``). If you request 12 nodes, Slurm is going to run code between those nodes, which could slow your job down significantly if it isn’t optimized to run between nodes.

   If your code is optimized to run on more than 2 nodes and needs less than one hour to run, you can use the express partition. If your code needs to run on more than 2 nodes for more than one hour, you should apply to use the large partition. See the section Partition Access Request below for more information.


.. _partition_access:

Partition Access Request
=========================

If you need access to the large, long, or multigpu partition, you need to submit a `ServiceNow ticket <https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7>`_.
Access is not automatically granted. You will need to provide details and test results that demonstrate your need for access for these partitions.
If you need temporary access to multigpu to perform testing before applying for permanent access,
you should also submit a `ServiceNow ticket <https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7>`_. All requests are evaluated by members of the RC team,
and multigpu requests are also evaluated by two faculty members.
