# MGHPCC Annual Shutdown


**Important Announcement: MGHPCC Annual Shutdown, Wednesday, May 22, 2024 – Friday, May 24, 2024**


All RC-managed services will be powered down **starting at 6 a.m. ET on Wednesday, May 22, 2024.**

The Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) will be conducting its annual shutdown for maintenance work on Thursday, May 23. To prepare for that maintenance, RC will be shutting down all services from Wednesday, May 22 until Friday, May 24. Research Computing’s servers and services are physically located at MGHPCC and are included in this shutdown, along with the high performance cluster systems of Harvard, Boston University, MIT, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. All RC-managed services will be powered down starting at 6 a.m. ET on Wednesday, May 22. We are currently anticipating that RC-managed services will be powered back on Friday, May 24, given that all work is completed in a timely manner.

{red}`During the annual maintenance period, you will not be able to access research computing facilities or services (including the Discovery Cluster). You should plan accordingly and proactively, especially if you have a research paper, proposal, or presentation deadline that may rely on RC-managed services right before, during, or soon after the annual maintenance period. You should not expect any access to RC-managed services between 6 a.m. ET on Wednesday, May 22, 2024, to late Friday, May 24 at minimum. If the recovery after the maintenance work does not go as planned, the services may not be back until Saturday, May 25, or later.`

How will the maintenance affect me:
All systems will be affected by the shutdown, including the CIFS mount /research, RC-hosted sites and services, all compute nodes, storage (including research and archive storage), and the Open OnDemand web portal. {red}`Please be aware that all running jobs will be terminated by 6 a.m. ET on May 22 as the system is powered down.`
