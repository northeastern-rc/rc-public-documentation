Working with GPUs
******************
The Discovery cluster has a number of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) available, as detailed in the table below.

These GPUs are available within two partitions, named ``gpu`` and ``multigpu``. Note that partitions on Discovery are not physical partitions, they  are virtual partitions.
The differences between the two partitions are the number of GPUs that you can request per job, as well as the time
limit on each job. Both partitions give you access to all of the above GPU types. See the table below for the differences between the two partitions. See :ref:`partition_names` for more information about all of the partitions on Discovery.

Anyone with an account on Discovery can use the ``gpu`` partition. Using ```multigpu`` requires an application process, which includes documenting
the need for using ``multigpu``. To request temporary access to multigpu for testing or to submit an application for full access, you need to fill out and submit a `ServiceNow ticket <https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7>`_.
After you submit a request, it is evaluated by members of the RC team. This is to ensure that the resources in this partition will be used appropriately.

Requesting GPUs with ``srun`` or ``sbatch``
===========================================
Use ``srun`` for interactive mode and ``sbatch`` for batch mode.

The ``srun`` example below is requesting 1 node and 1 GPU with 1GB of memory in the ``gpu`` partition. You must use the ``--gres=`` option to request a gpu. Note that on the ``gpu`` partition, you cannot request more than 1 GPU (``--gres=gpu:1``)
or your request will fail.

``srun --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --pty --export=All --gres=gpu:1 --mem=1G --time=00:30:00 /bin/bash``

The ``sbatch`` example below is the similar to the ``srun`` example above, except for giving the job a name and directing the output to a file::

  #SBATCH --nodes=1
  #SBATCH --time=0:30:00
  #SBATCH --job-name=gpu_run
  #SBATCH --mem=1G
  #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
  #SBATCH --output=exec.%j.out
  <your code>

Specifying a GPU type
+++++++++++++++++++++
You can add a specific type of GPU to the ``--gres=`` option (with either ``srun`` or ``sbatch``). The following example is requesting one k40m gpu::

  --gres=gpu:k40m:1

Note that specifying one type of GPU could result in a longer wait time for that specific resource. For a list of GPU types, refer to the GPU Types column in the table at the top of this page.

Using CUDA
===========
There are several versions of CUDA on Discovery, as listed below.::

  cuda/9.0
  cuda/9.2
  cuda/10.0
  cuda/10.2
  cuda/11.0

You can always use the ``module avail`` command to check for the latest software versions on Discovery as well.

To add CUDA to your path use ``module load``. For example, type ``module load cuda/10.0`` to load version 10 to your path.

Using GPUs with PyTorch
========================
You should use PyTorch with a conda virtual environment if you need to run the environment on the Nvidia GPUs on Discovery.

The following is an example of using a conda virtual environment with PyTorch. Make sure that you are on a GPU node before loading the environment::

  module load cuda/11.0
  module load anaconda3/3.7
  conda create --name pytorch_env python=3.7 anaconda
  conda activate pytorch_env
  conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch
  python -c'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())'

Using TensorFlow
================
We recommend that you use CUDA 10.2 with the latest version of TensorFlow.
You can find the compatibility of CUDA and TensorFlow versions at the following website https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu.::

  module load anaconda3/3.7
  module load cuda/10.2
  conda create --name TF_env python=3.7 anaconda #where TF_env is the name of the conda environment
  conda  activate TF_env
  conda install -c anaconda tensorflow-gpu

If you want to test your environment, first make sure you are on GPU node, then type::

   python -c 'import tensorflow as tf;  print(tf.test.is_built_with_cuda())'

You should see the result ``True`` if successful.

To get the name of the GPU, type::

   python -c 'import tensorflow as tf;  print(tf.test.gpu_device_name())'

For example, you should see output like the line below::

   physical GPU (device: 0, name: Tesla K40m, pci bus id: 0000:0b:00.0, compute capability: 3.5) /device:GPU:0
