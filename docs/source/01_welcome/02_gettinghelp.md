## Scheduling consultations

We encourage you to schedule a consultation with one of our staff members to receive personal, one-on-one assistance for your research computing and data storage needs. Consultations are available to any Northeastern student, faculty, or staff member. We can assist you with starting Discovery, optimizing your code, benchmarking, installing and using software packages, detailing data storage options, and more.

We offer consultations by appointment most weekdays during regular business hours (9 AM to 5 PM). Please note that we follow the Northeastern University holiday schedule, so no consultations are available on holidays or during breaks. All consultations are conducted online through the Teams app.

Use our [Bookings page](https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/) to view our availability and schedule an appointment. You must sign in using your **@northeastern.edu** email address (for example, **[a.student@northeastern.edu](mailto:a.student@northeastern.edu)**).

## Status Page

We use the ITS Systems Status page to post important information, such as power outages and maintenance windows. You can subscribe to this page to receive email updates on the status of ITS systems.
