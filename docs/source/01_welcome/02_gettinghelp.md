## Consultations (online)

We encourage you to schedule a consultation with one of our staff members to get personal, one-on-one assistance for your research computing and data storage needs.
Consultations are available to any Northeastern student, faculty, or staff member. We can assist you with getting up and running with Discovery, help to optimize your code, help you with benchmarking,
provide assistance with installing and using software packages, detailing data storage options, and much more.

We offer scheduled consultation hours most weekdays during normal business hours (9AM to 5PM). Note that we follow the Northeastern University
holiday schedule, so there are no consultation hours on holidays or during breaks. All of our consultations are conducted as online
meetings through the Teams app.

Use our [Bookings page](https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/) to see our availability and to schedule an appointment.
You will need to sign in using your **@northeastern.edu** email (for example, **a.student@northeastern.edu**).

We post important information, such as power outages and maintenance windows, to the [ITS Systems Status page](https://northeastern.statuspage.io/).
