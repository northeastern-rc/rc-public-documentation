# Welcome

Welcome to the official online help system for Northeastern University's Research Computing team! This documentation will assist you in using Northeastern's HPC cluster system. It contains the most up-to-date information and instructions on obtaining an account, connecting to the system, loading modules, running jobs, and storing data. If you are unfamiliar with high-performance computing, we recommend taking our training courses before using the system. For information on training and services, visit our [Research Computing team website].

This help system is frequently updated to reflect the latest discovery information and add new topics to assist you with your research. Check back often for updates.

We value your feedback! If you have any comments or suggestions for topics you want to be covered in this documentation, please submit a [Research Computing Documentation request].


## What is Discovery

Discovery is a high-performance computing (HPC) resource for the Northeastern University research community. The Discovery cluster is in the [Massachusetts Green HPC Center] (MGHPC) in Holyoke, MA. The MGHPC is a 90,000-square-foot, 15-megawatt research computing, and data center facility that houses computing resources for five institutions: Northeastern, BU, Harvard, MIT, and UMass.
