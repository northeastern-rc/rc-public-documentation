# Security and Compliance

Security and compliance in data management are essential to protect sensitive information and meet regulatory requirements. This page provides guidelines and best practices for ensuring data security and compliance on HPC systems.

## Data Classification

Understanding the sensitivity of your data is the first step in protecting it.

- **Identify Sensitive Data**: Recognize what data needs special protection.
- **Classify Accordingly**: Categorize data based on sensitivity.

## Access Control

Controlling who can access data is fundamental to security.

- **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Grant permissions based on roles.
- **Use Strong Authentication Methods**: Consider multi-factor authentication.
- **Regularly Review Access Rights**: Ensure only authorized individuals have access.

## Encryption

Encrypting data helps protect it from unauthorized access.

- **Encrypt Data at Rest**: Use file-level or disk encryption.
- **Encrypt Data in Transit**: Secure data when transferring between systems.

## Auditing and Monitoring

Track those who access data and when it is crucial for security.

- **Enable Logging**: Log all access and modifications to sensitive data.
- **Monitor Regularly**: Set up automated monitoring and alerts.

## Compliance Standards

Adhere to legal and organizational compliance standards.

- **Understand Applicable Regulations**: GDPR, HIPAA, or other relevant laws.
- **Follow Organizational Policies**: Adhere to your institution's policies.

## Incident Response

Prepare for and respond to any security incidents.

- **Have an Incident Response Plan**: Outline steps to take if a breach occurs.
- **Regularly Review and Update the Plan**: Keep it current with changing risks.

## Tips for Secure Data Management

- **Use Secure Connections**: SSH or {term}`VPN` for remote access.
- **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data on Shared File Systems**: Unless adequately secured.
- **Educate Yourself and Your Team**: Stay informed about best practices and threats.
