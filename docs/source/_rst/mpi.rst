Message Passing Interface (MPI) Overview
*****************************************
`Message Passing Interface (MPI) <https://www.mpi-forum.org>`_ is a standard for writing message-passing programs. MPI itself is not a
language. It defines a library interface, aimed at establishing a practical and easy-to-use standard for message passing.
There are several implementations of MPI, such as  `Open MPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_ and  `MVAPICH <http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/>`_.

MPI libraries on Discovery
================================
These are the current versions of Open MPI, MVAPICH, and `MPICH <https://www.mpich.org/>`_ that are available on Discovery as modules.

openmpi/4.1.0-zen2-gcc10.1
openmpi/4.1.0-amd-intel2021
openmpi/4.0.5-skylake-gcc7.3
openmpi/4.1.0-gcc10.1-cuda11.2
openmpi/4.0.4-amd-intel2020u2
openmpi/4.0.5
openmpi/4.0.5-skylake-gcc10.1
openmpi/4.0.3-cuda
mpich/3.3.2-skylake-gcc7.3
mvapich2/2.3.4-intel2020

Use the ``module show`` command to view information about the compilers you need to use with these libraries and if
they support InfiniBand (IB) or not. For example, ``module show openmpi/4.1.0-zen2-gcc10.1``.
