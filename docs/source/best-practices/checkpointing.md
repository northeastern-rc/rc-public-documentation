# Checkpointing Jobs

The complexity of HPC systems can introduce unpredictable hardware or software component behavior, leading to job failures. Applying fault tolerance techniques to your HPC workflows can make your jobs more resilient to crashes, partition time limits, and hardware failures.

## The Checkpointing technique
Checkpointing is a fault tolerance technique based on the Backward Error Recovery (BER) technique, designed to overcome "fail-stop" failures (interruptions during the execution of a job).

To implement checkpointing:

- Use data redundancy to create checkpoint files, saving all necessary calculation state data. Checkpoint files are generally created at constant intervals during the run.
- If a failure occurs, start from an error-free state, check for consistency, and restore the algorithm to the previous error-free state.

Checkpointing allows you to:

- Create resilient workflows in the event of faults.
- Overcome most scheduler resource time limitations, and efficiently use the `lowpriority` partition.
- Implement an early error detection approach by inspecting intermediate results.

## Checkpointing types
Checkpointing can be implemented at different levels of your workflow.

- **Application-level** checkpointing is recommended for most Discovery users. You can use the checkpointing tool that is already available in your software application. For example, most software designed for HPC has a checkpointing option, and information on proper usage is often available in the software user manual.
- **User-level** checkpointing is good if you develop your code or know the application code well enough to integrate checkpointing techniques effectively. We recommend this approach for some Discovery users with advanced proficiency and familiarity with checkpointing mechanisms.
- **System-level** checkpointing is done on the system side, where the user saves the state of the entire process. This option is less efficient than User-level or Application-level checkpointing as it introduces a lot of redundancy.
- **Model-level** checkpointing is suitable for saving a model's internal state (its weights, current learning rate, etc.) so that the framework can resume the training from this point whenever desired. This is often the intent of users doing machine learning on Discovery.

### Which checkpoint type should you use?

There are several checkpointing options, depending on your software's needs.

- If your software already includes **built-in checkpointing**, this is often the preferred option, as it is the most optimized and efficient way to checkpoint.
- **Application-level** checkpointing is the easiest to use, as it exists within your application. It does not require significant script changes and saves only the relevant data for your specific application.
- **User-level** checkpointing is recommended if you are writing your code. You can use DMTCP or implement checkpointing.
- **ML Model-level** checkpointing is specific to model training and deployment, as detailed in the `ML Model-level`_ section.

:::{note}
Some packages can be used to implement checkpointing if you are developing in Python, Matlab, or R. Some examples include [Python PyTorch checkpointing], [TensorFlow checkpointing], [MATLAB checkpointing], and [R checkpointing]. Additionally, many Computational Chemistry and Molecular Dynamics software packages have built-in checkpointing options (e.g., [GROMACS] and [LAMMPS]).
:::

Implementing checkpointing can be achieved by the following:
- Some save-and-load mechanisms of your calculation state.
- The use of [Slurm Job Arrays].

:::{note}
To overcome partition time limits, or to use the `lowpriority` partition effectively, replace your single long job with multiple shorter jobs. Using job arrays, set each job to run one after the other. Each job will write a checkpoint file if checkpointing is implemented. The next job in line will be the latest checkpoint file to continue from the latest state of the calculation.

## Application-level checkpointing

### GROMACS checkpointing example

The following example shows how to implement a 120-hour [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) job using multiple shorter jobs on the *short* or the  or the *lowpriority* partition. We use Slurm job arrays and the GROMACS built-in checkpointing option to implement checkpointing.

:::{seealso}
[https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/managing-simulations.html](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/managing-simulations.html)
:::
The following script `submit_mdrun_array.sh` creates a Slurm job array of 10 individual array jobs:

:::{code} shell
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=short,lowpriority
#SBATCH --constraint=cascadelake
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --time=12:00:00
#SBATCH --job-name=myrun
#SBATCH --ntasks=56
#SBATCH --array=1-10%1  # execute 10 array jobs, 1 at a time
#SBATCH --output=myrun-%A_%a.out
#SBATCH --error=myrun-%A_%a.err

module load cuda/10.2
module load gcc/7.3.0
module load openmpi/4.0.5-skylake-gcc7.3
module load gromacs/2020.3-gpu-mpi
source /shared/centos7/gromacs/2020.3-gcc7.3/bin/GMXRC.bash

srun --mpi=pmi2 -n $SLURM_NTASKS gmx_mpi mdrun -ntomp 1 -s myrun.tpr -v -dlb yes -cpi state
:::

The script above sets the checkpoint flag `-cpi state` preceding the filename to dump checkpoints. This directs `mdrun` to the checkpoint in `state.cpt` when loading the state. The Slurm option `--array=1-10%1` creates 10 Slurm array tasks and runs one task job serially for 12 hours. The variable `%A` denotes the main job ID, while `%a` denotes the task ID (i.e., spanning `1-10`).

To submit this array job to the scheduler, use the following command:

:::{code} shell
sbatch submit_mdrun_array.bash
:::

### DMTCP checkpoint example

Distributed MultiThreaded checkpointing ([DMTCP](https://dmtcp.sourceforge.io/)) is a tool checkpoint without changing code. It works with most Linux applications, such as Python, Matlab, R, GUI, and MPI.

The program runs in the background of your program, without significant performance loss and saves the process states into checkpoint files. DMTCP is available on the cluster

:::{code} shell
module avail dmtcp
module show dmtcp
module load dmtcp/2.6.0
:::

Since DMTCP runs in the background, it requires some changes to your shell script. See [examples of checkpointing with DMTCP](https://github.com/northeastern-rc/training-checkpointing/tree/main/Exercise_3), which use DMTCP with a simple C++ program (scripts modified from [RSE-Cambridge](https://github.com/RSE-Cambridge/dmtcp-tests)).


### Application-level checkpointing tips

What data should you save?
- Non-temporary application data
- Any application data that has been modified since the last checkpoint
- Delete no longer useful checkpoints; keep only the most recent checkpoint file.

How frequently do checkpoints occur?
- Too often will slow your calculation; maybe I/O is heavy and memory intensive.
- Too infrequently leads to large or long rollback times.
- Consider how long it takes to reach a checkpoint and restart your calculation.
- In most cases, every 10â€“15 minutes is okay.

## ML Model-level Checkpointing
Model-level checkpointing is a technique used to periodically save the state of a machine learning (ML) model during training, enabling the training process to be resumed from the saved checkpoint in case of interruptions or premature termination. The saved state typically includes the model's parameters, optimizer state, and essential training information (e.g., the epoch number and loss value). Model checkpoints are especially critical for long-running training jobs.

### Why is Checkpointing Important in Deep Learning?
Checkpointing is crucial in deep learning because the training process can be time-consuming and require significant computational resources. Additionally, the training process may be interrupted due to hardware or software issues. Checkpoints solve this problem by saving the model's current state to resume where it left off.

Moreover, checkpointing also saves the best-performing model, which can be loaded for evaluation. For instance, the model's performance can vary based on the initialization and optimization algorithms, so checkpointing provides a way to select the best model based on a performance metric.

In summary, checkpointing is essential in deep learning as it provides a way to save progress, resume training, and select the best-performing model.

### TensorFlow checkpoint example

The following example demonstrates implementing a longer ML job using the [*tf.keras* checkpointing API](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load) and multiple shorter Slurm job arrays on the GPU partition.

The following example of the `submit_tf_array.bash` script:

:::{code} shell
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=myrun
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --partition=gpu,lowpriority
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH --mem=10Gb
#SBATCH --output=%A-%a.out
#SBATCH --error=%A-%a.err
#SBATCH --array=1-10%1  #execute 10 array jobs, 1 at a time.

module load miniconda3/2020-09
source activate tf_gpu

# Define the number of steps based on the job id:
numOfSteps=$(( 500 * SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID ))

# Run python and save outputs to a log file corresponding to the current job task ID
python train_with_checkpoints.py $numOfSteps &> log.$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
:::

The following checkpoint example is given in the program `train_with_checkpoints.py`:

:::{code} python
checkpoint_path = "training_2/{epoch:d}.ckpt"
checkpoint_dir = os.path.dirname(checkpoint_path)
cp_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
   filepath=checkpoint_path,
   verbose=1,
   save_weights_only=True,
   period=5)
:::

[See scripts](https://github.com/northeastern-rc/training-checkpointing/tree/main/Exercise_2), which are modified from [TensorFlow Save and load models](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load).

The Slurm option `--array=1-10%1` will create 10 Slurm array tasks and run one task at a time. Note that the saved variable `%A` denotes the main job ID, while variable `%a` denotes the task ID (spanning values 1-10). Note that the output/error files are also unique to prevent different jobs from writing to the same files. The Shell variable `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` holds the unique task ID value and can be used within the Slurm Shell script to point to different files or variables.

To submit this job to the scheduler, use the command:

:::{code} shell
sbatch submit_tf_array.bash

#### Setting up a Sample Project

Next, we will set up a sample project to demonstrate checkpointing in PyTorch. We will create a simple neural network in PyTorch and train it on a sample dataset. The following code creates a simple neural network in PyTorch:

:::{code} python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(28 * 28, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(-1, 28 * 28)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
:::

Once the neural network is defined, we can load a sample dataset and train the model. In this example, we will use the MNIST dataset in the `torchvision` library. The following code loads the MNIST dataset and trains the model:

:::{code}
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))
])

trainset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
net = Net()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

for epoch in range(2):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()
    print('Epoch %d loss: %.3f' % (epoch + 1, running_loss / len(trainloader)))

:::

With this simple project setup, we can demonstrate checkpointing in PyTorch.

#### What is the model state in PyTorch?

In PyTorch, the model state refers to the values of all the parameters, weights, and biases that define the model's behavior. This state is stored in the modelâ€™s `state_dict`, a dictionary-like object that maps each layer to its parameter tensors. Additionally, the `state_dict` contains information about the model's architecture and the values of the parameters learned during training.

The `state_dict` can be saved to a file using PyTorchâ€™s `torch.save` function and loaded back into memory using `torch.load`. This allows for checkpointing, which saves the state of a model periodically during training so that it can be recovered in the case of a crash or interruption.

PyTorch also provides the ability to save and load the entire model, including the model's architecture and optimizer state, using the `torch.save` and `torch.load` functions. This allows for complete checkpointing of a model's state.

It is important to note that the `state_dict` only contains information about the model's parameters, not the optimizer or other training-related information. So, to save the optimizer state, you also need to save it separately and load it back when loading the model.

In conclusion, the model state in PyTorch represents the values of all the parameters, weights, and biases that define the model's behavior. The state is stored in the `state_dict` and can be saved and loaded for checkpointing purposes. By saving the model state periodically during training, you can ensure that your progress is recovered during a crash or interruption.
#### Saving a PyTorch Model

##### Saving a Model's `state_dict`
To save the learnable parameters of a PyTorch model and the optimizer, we must save the model's `state_dict`. We can use the `torch.save` function to pass the state_dict and file names as arguments. The following code demonstrates how to save the state_dict of the model:

:::{code} python
checkpoint_path = 'checkpoint.pth'
state = {'epoch': epoch + 1,
         'state_dict': net.state_dict(),
         'optimizer': optimizer.state_dict()}
torch.save(state, checkpoint_path)
:::

##### Saving the Entire Model

In addition to saving the state_dict, we can also save the entire model, which includes the architecture, the learnable parameters, and the optimizer state. We can use the `torch.save()` function to save the entire model by passing the model and a filename as arguments. The following code demonstrates how to save the entire model:

:::{code} python
model_path = 'model.pth'
torch.save(net, model_path)
:::

:::{note}
When saving the entire model, the custom classes used to define the model must be importable, either as a part of the project or in a separate file that can be imported.
:::

We have seen how to save the state_dict and the entire model in PyTorch. The following section will show how to load a saved model.

(load-pytorch-model)=
#### Loading a PyTorch Model

##### Loading a PyTorch `state_dict`

We can use the **`torch.load`** function to load the `state_dict` of a saved model by passing the file name as an argument. After loading the `state_dict`, we can set the `state_dict` of the model using the **`model.load_state_dict`** method. The following code demonstrates how to load the `state_dict` of a saved model:

:::{code} python
codecheckpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path)
net.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state_dict'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer'])
epoch = checkpoint['epoch']
:::


##### Loading the Entire PyTorch Model

To load the entire model, use the `torch.load` function and pass the file name as an argument. The loaded model can then be assigned to a variable, as shown in the following code:

:::{code} python
loaded_model = torch.load(model_path)
:::

In PyTorch, we can load a saved model's `state_dict` or the entire model. This section will cover how to resume training from a checkpoint.

#### Resuming Training from a Checkpoint

To resume training from a checkpoint, we must load the model's `state_dict` and the optimizer's state (see {ref}`load-pytorch-model`). After loading these, we can continue the training process from where it was left off. The following code demonstrates how to resume training from a checkpoint:

:::{code} python
checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path)
net.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state_dict'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer'])
epoch = checkpoint['epoch'] # Continue training
for epoch inrange(epoch, num_epochs): # Train the model
    # Save the checkpoint
    state = {'epoch': epoch + 1,
             'state_dict': net.state_dict(),
             'optimizer': optimizer.state_dict()
             }
torch.save(state, checkpoint_path)
:::

This code loads the `state_dict` and the optimizer's state from the checkpoint file and resumes training from the `epoch` value saved in the checkpoint file. After each epoch, the model's `state_dict` and the optimizer's state are saved in the checkpoint file, as described in Section III. This shows how to checkpoint PyTorch models, save and load the `state_dict`, save and load the entire model, and resume training from a checkpoint.


### Model-level tips and tricks

#### Save only the model's State_dict
Save only the model's state_dict and optimizer state, allowing us to save only the information needed to resume training. Doing so reduces the checkpoint file's size and makes it easier to load the model. So, please don't forget to avoid unnecessary information in the checkpoint file, such as irrelevant metadata or tensors we can define during training.

#### Save regularly
To prevent losing progress in case of a crash or interruption, save the checkpoint file regularly (i.e., after each epoch).

#### Save to multiple locations
Save the checkpoint file to multiple locations, such as a local drive and the cloud, to ensure that the checkpoint is recovered in case of failure.

#### Use the latest versions of libraries
Using the latest version of PyTorch and other relevant libraries is vital; changes in these libraries may cause compatibility issues with older checkpoints. With these best practices, you can ensure that your PyTorch models are saved efficiently and effectively and that your progress is not lost in the event of a crash or interruption.

#### Naming conventions
Use a consistent naming convention for checkpoint files; include information such as the date, time, and epoch number in the file name to make tracking multiple checkpoint files easier and ensure you choose the proper checkpoint to load.

#### Checkpoint Validation
Validate the checkpoint after loading it to ensure that the model's state_dict and the optimizer's state are correctly loaded by making a prediction using the loaded model and checking that the results are as expected.

#### Periodic clean-up
Periodically, remove old checkpoint files to avoid filling up storage. This can be done by keeping only the latest
checkpoint or keeping only checkpoint files from the last few epochs.

#### Document checkpoints
Document the purpose of each checkpoint and what it contains: the model architecture, the training data, the hyperparameters, and the performance metrics. This will help keep track of the progress and make it easier to compare different checkpoints. With these additional best practices, you can ensure that your checkpointing process is efficient, effective, and well-organized.
