## The HPC Cluster

Our cluster is a high-performance computing (HPC) resource available to the Northeastern University research community. The cluster is in the Massachusetts Green HPC Center (MGHPC) in Holyoke, MA. MGHPC is a 90,000 square food, 15-megawatt research computing and data center facility that houses computing resources for five institutions: Northeastern University, Boston University, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the University of Massachesetts (UMass).
