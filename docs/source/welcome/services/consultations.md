# Consultations

We encourage you to schedule a consultation with one of our staff members to receive personal, one-on-one assistance for your research computing, data storage, or classroom needs. Consultations are available to any Northeastern student, faculty, or staff member. We can help you get started on the cluster, optimize your code, benchmark, install and use software packages, detail data storage options, and more.

We offer consultations by appointment most weekdays during regular business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). We follow the Northeastern University holiday schedule, so no consultations are available on holidays or during breaks. All consultations are conducted online through the Teams application.

Use our [Bookings page](https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/) to view our availability and schedule an appointment. You must sign in using your **@northeastern.edu** email address (for example, **[a.student@northeastern.edu](mailto:a.student@northeastern.edu)**).
