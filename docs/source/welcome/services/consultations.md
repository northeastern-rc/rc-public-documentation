# Consultations

You can schedule a consultation with RC to receive personal, one-on-one assistance for your research computing, data storage, or classroom needs. Consultations are available to any Northeastern student, faculty, or staff member. RC can help you with topics like, getting started on the cluster, optimizing your code, benchmarking, or installing and using software packages.

We offer consultations by appointment most weekdays during regular business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). We follow the Northeastern University holiday schedule, so no consultations are available on holidays or during breaks. All consultations are conducted online through the Teams application.

Use our [Bookings page](https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/) to view our availability and schedule an appointment. You must sign in using your **@northeastern.edu** email address (for example, **[a.student@northeastern.edu](mailto:a.student@northeastern.edu)**).
