# Consultations

You can schedule a consultation with RC to receive personal, one-on-one assistance for your research computing, data storage, or classroom needs. Consultations are available to any Northeastern student, faculty, or staff member. RC can help you with topics like, getting started on the cluster, optimizing your code, benchmarking, or installing and using software packages.

RC offers online consultations, by appointment, on weekdays during regular business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET). Use RC's [Getting Help page](https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/gettinghelp/) to learn more about consultations. You must sign in using your **@northeastern.edu** email address (for example, **[a.student@northeastern.edu](mailto:a.student@northeastern.edu)**). Please note, consultations are not available during Northeastern University holidays.

## Office Hours

In addition to scheduled consultations, the RC team offers weekly office hours as a convenient way for current and prospective Discovery users to connect with the team. These sessions are great for quick check-ins (typically 10–15 minutes) where you can ask questions, learn more about available services, or get help with your research computing needs.
