# Consultations

You can schedule a consultation with RC to receive personal, one-on-one assistance for your research computing, data storage, or classroom needs. Consultations are available to any Northeastern student, faculty, or staff member. RC can help you with topics like, getting started on the cluster, optimizing your code, benchmarking, or installing and using software packages.

RC offers online consultations, by appointment, on weekdays during regular business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET). Use RC's [Getting Help page](https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/gettinghelp/) to learn more about consultations. You must sign in using your **@northeastern.edu** email address (for example, **[a.student@northeastern.edu](mailto:a.student@northeastern.edu)**). Please note, consultations are not available during Northeastern University holidays.
