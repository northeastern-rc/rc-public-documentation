# Training sessions

The RC Team provides free online training sessions for cluster users and Northeastern students interested in learning more.

If you’re new to Discovery or HPC, we strongly recommend watching the [Discovery Introduction Video](https://www.linkedin.com/checkpoint/enterprise/login/74653650?pathWildcard=74653650&application=learning&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Flearning%2Fcontent%2F1139340%3Fu%3D74653650). You’ll need to sign in using your Northeastern username and password to view the video.

Recorded RC training sessions have been added to the [Research Computing Training Course in Canvas](https://northeastern.instructure.com/enroll/LNNCHN). Once you’ve clicked the link to enroll, you must log in using your Northeastern credentials.

The training sessions cover a wide range of skill levels, from beginner to advanced, and offer you the opportunity to explore training sessions at your own pace in the areas that you’re most interested in (e.g., Linux and Shell Scripting, Slurm Arrays, Software Installation, GPUs, Bioinformatics, Deep Learning, and LAMMPs). You can perform hands-on training exercises by accessing RC files shared on GitHub repositories.

If you are a faculty member using Discovery with your class and would like us to develop or present a personalized training session for your class, please reach out to us at [rc.northeastern.edu](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frc.northeastern.edu%2F&data=04%7C01%7Ct.ketchem%40NORTHEASTERN.EDU%7C0df6c43eab514b8a96c708da141e534c%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637844417724461490%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=KAEsJGBJg%2FwhHoPdAb%2B4JkkraL385D4mxEufV9AAi30%3D&reserved=0). All Discovery users can also reach out with suggestions for future training topics!
