# Introduction to OOD

Open OnDemand (OOD) is a web portal to the Discovery cluster. A Discovery account is necessary for you to access OOD. If you need an account, see {ref}`Request an account <getting-access>`. If you already have an account, in a web browser go to <http://ood.discovery.neu.edu> and sign in with your Northeastern username and password.

OOD provides you with several resources for interacting with the Discovery cluster:

- Launch a terminal within your web browser without needing a separate terminal program. This is an advantage if you use Windows, as otherwise, you need to download and use a separately installed program, such as MobaXterm.
- Use software applications like SAS Studio that run in your browser without further configuration. 
- View, download, copy, and delete files using the Files application.
- See the [Research Computing website](https://rc.northeastern.edu/ood/) for a full list of applications offered on the OOD.

OOD is a web-based application. You access it by using a web browser. Like many web-based applications, it has compatibility issues with specific web browsers. Use OOD with newer Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer versions for optimal results. OOD does not currently support Safari or mobile devices (phones and tablets).
