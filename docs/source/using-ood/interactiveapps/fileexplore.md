# OOD File Explorer

When working with the resources in OOD, your files are stored in your home directory
on the storage space on the Discovery cluster. Like any file navigation system,
you can work with your files and directories through the OOD Files feature, as detailed below.
For example, you can download a Jupyter Notebook file in OOD that youâ€™ve been working
on to your local hard drive, rename a file, or delete a file you no longer need.

:::{note}
Your home directory has a file size limit of 75GB. Be sure to check your home
directory regularly, and remove any files you do not need to ensure you have enough space.
:::

1. In a web browser, go to [ood.discovery.neu.edu](https://ood.discovery.neu.edu). If prompted, enter your myNortheastern username and password.
1. Select **Files > Home Directory**. The contents of your home directory display in a new tab.
1. To download a file to your hard drive, navigate to the file you want to download,
   select the file, and click **Download**. If prompted by your browser,
   click **OK** to save your file to your hard drive.
1. To navigate to another folder on the Discovery file system, click **Go To**,
   enter the path to the folder you want to access and click **OK**.

:::{note}
From the **Files > Home Directory** view, the **Edit** button will not launch your
.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook. It will open the file in a text editor. You must be in Jupyter Notebook to launch a `.ipynb` file from your /home directory.
See {ref}`interactive-ood-apps` to access a Jupyter Notebook through OOD.
