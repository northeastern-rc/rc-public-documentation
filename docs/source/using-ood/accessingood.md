# Accessing Open OnDemand

Open OnDemand (OOD) is a web portal to the HPC cluster.

This topic is for connecting to the HPC cluster through the browser application Open OnDemand. If you want to access the HPC directly on your system rather than through a browser, please see {ref}`connect-to-cluster`, whether Mac or Windows.

A cluster account is necessary for you to access OOD. If you need an account, see {ref}`getting-access`. After you have created a cluster account, **access the cluster through Open OnDemand (OOD) via the following steps:**

1. In a web browser, go to <http://ood.discovery.neu.edu>.
1. At the prompt, enter your Northeastern username and password. Note that your username is the first part of your email without the @northeastern, such as **j.smith**.
1. Press **Enter** or click **Sign in**.
