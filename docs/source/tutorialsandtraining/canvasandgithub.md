It can take upwards of 30 hours to run variant calling on a single sample, it could take months or even years to process thousands of samples. This is where CLARA Parabricks comes in. Using GPU acceleration, we have cut down the variant calling time to below 30 minutes for a 30x human genome. This allows for new genomics projects to be done at a scale that was not previously possible. In this session, we will discuss the capabilities of Parabricks, the performance compared to traditional genomics software packages (such as GATK), and show a demo of what it looks like in action.
