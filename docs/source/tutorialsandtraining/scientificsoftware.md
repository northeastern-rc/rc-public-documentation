# Getting Started with Scientific Software 

The Research Computing team has created a collection of [scripts](https://github.com/northeastern-rc/discovery-example-scripts) to assist you in getting started with different scientific software packages on discovery. Although these scripts may not have all the solutions, they aim to provide users with a starting point to grasp the syntax and procedures used in various applications.
