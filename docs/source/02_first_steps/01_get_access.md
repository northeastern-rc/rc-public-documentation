## Request an account

You must first have an account before you can access Discovery. You request an account through ServiceNow.
You will need a Northeastern username and password to access ServiceNow. If you are new to the university or a visiting researcher,
work with your sponsor to get a Northeastern username and password.

:::{important}
If you previously had access to Discovery, but you are now working with a different PI, submit a [ServiceNow RC Access Request form] and enter the name of your current PI in the Sponsor field. This will link your account to your current PI. This expedites the process for updating your account with any of your current PI's resources on Discovery, such as shared storage or a private partition.

:::{sidebar} Valid NU Credentials
Access to the cluster is limited to people affiliated with Northeastern who have a valid NU username and password. Research Computing is not able to create or renew Northeastern accounts. You must work with your sponsor to obtain or update credentials, if need be.
:::

**To request an account, follow these steps:**

1. Visit [ServiceNow RC Access Request form].
2. Complete form, check the acknowledgement box, and Submit.

Your request can take up to 24 hours to process after it has been approved by your sponsor (see Sponsor Approval Process below). You will receive a confirmation email when your access has been granted.
After you have access, if you are not familiar with using Discovery, high performance computing, or Linux, you should take one of our training courses.
See the [Research Computing website](https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/training/) for more information on our training and services.

### Principal Investigator(PI)/Professor/Instructor Access

If you are a PI, professor, or instructor at Northeastern, and you need access to Discovery, you should use the access form in the
above procedure, and in the Sponsor name field on the form, enter your own name.

### Sponsor Approval Process

HPC users needs a sponsor approve their request, usually a NU PI or professor. PIs, professors, and instructors can sponsor themselves.
Students (undergraduate or graduate), visiting researchers, or staff members must have a sponsor approve their request. When you fill out the
ServiceNow form, an email goes to the specified sponsor upon submitting request. Sponsors will receive email reminders until they approve the request through the link in the email to ServiceNow. We recommended letting your sponsor know to look for the email with the approval link that before submitting an access request.
