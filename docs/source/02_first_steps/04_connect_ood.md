# Accessing Open OnDemand (OOD)

Open OnDemand (OOD) is a web portal to the Discovery cluster.

This topic is for connecting to the Discovery cluster through the browser application, Open OnDemand.
If you are looking to access Discovery directly on your system rather than through a browser,
please see {ref}`connect_mac` for connecting with a Mac and {ref}`connect_windows` for connecting with Windows.

A Discovery account is necessary for you to access OOD. If you need an account,
see {ref}`getting_access`. After you have created a Discovery account,
proceed with the following steps in order to access Discovery.

**To Access Discovery through Open OnDemand (OOD), do the following**

> 1. In a web browser, go to <http://ood.discovery.neu.edu>.
> 2. At the prompt, enter your Northeastern username and password. Note that your username is the first part of your email without the @northeastern,
>    such as **j.smith**.
> 3. Press **Enter** or click **Sign in**.
