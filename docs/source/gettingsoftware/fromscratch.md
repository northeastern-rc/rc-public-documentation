## Installing Your Own Software

Information

## Make

If you want to use `make` to add software locally to you path you must first download the
software package from its source (such as a webpage or GitHub), and you need to unpack it or unzip it, if need be.
Then, you must set the installation path to a directory where you have write access on Discovery, such as your home directory.
You can use `./configure` to do this, such as  `./configure --prefix=/home/<yourusername>/software`
After you have set the installation path, you need to compile the code using `make` and then install the software using `make install`.
